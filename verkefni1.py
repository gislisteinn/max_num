#Algorythm:

#problem 1: we need an input from the user, use the input fundction for that
#Problem 2: we are supposed to keep asking him for an input while the input is >= 0 so for that we can use a while loop but we need to start outside the loop




num_int = int(input("Input a number: "))    # Do not change this line
while num_int >= 0:
    num_int = int(input("Input a number: ")) 

print("The maximum is", max_int)    # Do not change this line
